# Convex-Hull-using-Jarvis-March-Algorithm

#### Intro

Gift Wrapping algorithm, also known as the Jarvis March algorithm is an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points. 
The algorithm checks all n points for every point on the hull.
Hence if there are h point on the hull, the complexity would become (n * h).


Implemented the algorithm as well as the code for visualizing the convex hull using pygame.
